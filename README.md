This Repository contains 
1.  test.csv and train.csv dataset files
2.  presentation slides as pdf
3.  google colab notebook that uses dataset from github
   1. RandomForestClassifier.ipnyb that gives submission_test.csv file accuracy 78.7%
   2. DecisionTreeClassifier.ipnyb that gives final_submission_test.csv file accuracy 50%
4.  submission_test.csv
5.  final_submission_test.csv
6.  ReadMe file
